Task 10 -While running script, you have observed "NoSuchElementException". But you have taken
the correct locator(ID, XPATh or CSS). Still, you are facing the same issue. What might be the reason?

There are some issues that could trigger a "NoSuchElementException" error. The most common (usually
80% of the occurrences) is a slow webpage. The implicit timeout of the webdriver times out and

Other option is that the element is hidden.
If that the case, the webdriver is not able to see it and times out with this error.

Another one could be that, if running a page with multiple frames, the focus is located in a frame that has
no access to the element, thus making it unavailable to the driver.
