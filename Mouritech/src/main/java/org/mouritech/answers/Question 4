Can we call parent class constructor in sub class constructor i.e constructor chaining by using super keyword?

 Subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass.
  Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, 
  but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
